## About the App ℹ️

PhishCatch is an advanced Phishing Detection App developed as part of my final year project at the university. It is designed to protect users from phishing attempts by analyzing messages and URLs for potential threats. The app leverages machine learning techniques, including natural language processing and pattern recognition, to identify suspicious content and URLs.

With an emphasis on precision, PhishCatch employs Multinomial Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers to minimize false positives and ensure accurate detection. The app is built with Python 3.6.10 and utilizes popular libraries such as Scikit-Learn and NLTK for efficient analysis and prediction.
